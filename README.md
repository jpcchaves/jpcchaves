## Projects

### [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/jpcchaves/clean-architecture)
The project uses clean architecture principles with Java Modularity, including Core (business rules, domain entities), Usecase (application-specific logic), Application (use case implementation and gateway interfaces), and Infrastructure (external services, data access via Spring Boot). This ensures separation of concerns, keeping business logic decoupled from infrastructure.

### [Adotar](https://github.com/jpcchaves/adotar-back)
Adotar is a project focused on solving the challenges around animal adoption. I contributed as a full-stack developer, utilizing Java and Spring Boot for the backend and React with TypeScript on the frontend to create a smooth and efficient user experience.
